        <header>About Me</header>
        <p>My name is Nataliia but everybody calls me Natasha. I grew up in a beautiful city Kiev in Ukraine. 
            Recently I moved to the United States to live with my husband on his motherland. 
            <br>
            I have a bachelor degree in psychology, I had a lot of fun studying it in college.
            I love learning everything about human brain and body, about productivity, self-improvement and the learning prosses itself. 
            <br>
            I’m a person of broad interests, I’ve tried and enjoyed doing a lot of things including photography, making my own clothes,
            bailey dancing, professional hiking and even hairdressing.
            <br>  
            But my current passion is about computers. I’ve always been keen of constant learning and a good chellenge. 
            I love web world and I can’t imagine my life without it (just like anybody else nowadays). 
            My goal is to be able to make beautiful and intuitive web sites and applications and make 
            Internet a nice friendly virtual environment. 
            <br> 
            I also love learning English and keep improving my language skills every day. </p>
