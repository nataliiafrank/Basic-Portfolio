    <p><img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="picture-of-me" id="profile-picture">My name is Nataliia but everybody calls me Natasha. 
        I grew up in the beautiful city of Kiev in Ukraine. 
        Recently I moved to the United States to live with my husband in his home country.
        <br><br>
        I have a bachelors degree in psychology, I had a lot of fun studying it in college. 
        I love learning everything about the human brain and body, about productivity, 
        self-improvement and the learning process itself. 
        <br><br>
        I’m a person of broad interests, I’ve tried and enjoyed doing a lot of things including photography, making my own clothes,
        ballet dancing, professional hiking and even hairdressing.  
        But my current passion is computers. I’ve always liked constant learning and a good challenge. 
        I love the web world and I couldn’t imagine my life without it (just like everybody else nowadays). 
        My goal is to be able to make beautiful and intuitive web sites and applications and make the 
        Internet a nice friendly virtual environment. 
        <br><br>
        I also love learning English and I keep improving my language skills every day. </p>
